# RULES from Mintbean
Turn-based (i.e. no real-time puzzle games. They must be turn-based.)

Built in JavaScript web tech. No Unity or Unreal. PhaserJS and similar frameworks are OK.

There is some kind of timer.

There is a win condition. For example, you need to sort all the numbers.

The win condition is clear. For example, a popup says "Sort the numbers!"

There is a lose condition. For example, you have max 200 moves.

The lose condition is intuitive. For example, if you run out of moves or time, you lose.

When you lose, you can press a button to easily restart.

# Tetris Rules 
    Start: A single shape drops from the top of the screen
    
    The shape must be able to route in four directions, either clock wise or counter clockwise 
    
    The shape must slowly drop to the bottom of the screen and stay there is the same given positions. 
    
    End: Once the shape in at the bottom, it will stay in that position
    
    The next shape cannot occupy the same location as the previous same. 
    
    If consecutive shapes create a full line, that line will be destroyed. 

 ~Questions

  What is the ultimate win condition?

  Do we want the game to speed up as time goes one?

  Do we want a score board?  

# Required steps 
Need to have a window where the shapes can appear
